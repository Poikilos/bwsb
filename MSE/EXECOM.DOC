 The EXECOM utility is copyrighted, and may not be distributed in modified
 form or without the original documentation and files.  Subject to those
 limitations, it may be freely distributed.  No fee may be charged for such
 duplication, aside from a disk copying fee (if applicable) of not more than
 $6.00.  EXECOM may also be modified by you, for your own use only.

 The EXECOM utility is a replacement for the EXE2BIN program that used to be
 distributed with DOS.

 EXECOM is less powerful than EXE2BIN in that it does not support segment
 fixups.  Most people will never notice this difference.

 EXECOM is different than EXE2BIN in that it produces .COM files instead of
 .BIN files by default, and in that it deletes the original .EXE file if
 successful.

 EXECOM is better than EXE2BIN because: it's smaller, it's faster (especially
 for larger files), it comes with source code, and... it's free.

 Acknowledgements: EXECOM was based, in a large part, on Chris Dunford's
 EXE2COM utility, which was written in C.
